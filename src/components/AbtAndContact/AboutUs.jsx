          At Pet Haven, we work with local shelters and foster homes to care for pets and provide them with medical care, food, and love 
          until they are adopted. Whether you're looking for a playful puppy, a cuddly kitten, or a calm senior companion, 
          weâ€™re here to help you find your perfect match.
